*Diaspora* is an unfamiliar word for most people. The following is a brief explainer of what is meant by the terms *diaspora* and *diaspora missions* and why they are so important for local churches in America today.

## What is a diaspora?
*Diaspora* is a Bible word. It appears three times in the New Testament where it refers to the Jewish peoples who are scattered outside of their home country. The words root come from the Greek work *diaspeirein* which simply means to scatter or disperse. When think of a diaspora, you can think of the farmer who scatteres seed across the ground or of the little girl who blows the seeds off a dandelion. These pictures caputer the idea behind the word diaspora. However, both in the Bible and in modern usage, the term refers specifically to the scattering of peoples. 

We can define *diaspora* as a group of people who live somewhere outside of their homeland. These groups of people are the result of unprecedented global migration in the last several decades. This migration of people groups from one country to another happens for many reasons. Some move because of war, famine, persecution, or natural disasters. Others move because of oppotunities for education or career advancement. Some are forced out of their homes by oppressive governments. Some leabe for fear of termination because of their beliefs (Wan, *[Diaspora Missiology](https://amzn.to/3q9Px5l)*, 2011). With the ease of modern transporation, it is easiter than ever to start the day in one country and end it in another. Add all of these reasons together, and more people are moving around than world than any moment in recorded history.

These groups of people, or diasporas, leave their homw and establish new communities in other countries. These communities are often called [ethnic enclaves](https://keelancook.com/2017/02/22/what-is-an-ethnic-enclave-and-why-should-i-care/). An ethnic enclave, simply put, is an area (usually a neighborhood) in city where a large concentration of people from a similar ethnic background develops. 

These diaspora communities are becoming very common here in the United States. The U.S. is far and away the biggest recipient country of global immigration, and has [more immigrants than any other country in the world](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/08/20/key-findings-about-u-s-immigrants/). Over 40 million foreign born people live in the United States, which means roughly 14% of the population was born in another country. In 2018, the Brookings Institute predicted that current trends would mean the [white population would be a minority in the United States by 2045](https://keelancook.com/2018/03/15/in-the-news-whites-a-minority-by-2045/). However, Brookings has since suggested this [may occur even sooner](https://www.brookings.edu/research/new-census-data-shows-the-nation-is-diversifying-even-faster-than-predicted/) with the initial release of 2020 census data.

In short, the face of America is changing. Now more than ever, you are more likely to have a neighbor from another country who speaks a different language and quite possibly has a completely different religion. Immigrant communities are no longer isolated to big cities. Suburbs and even rural areas are developing ethnic enclaves of their own, and we now all live within arms reach of these communities of people from different cultures and places.

But the Bible is clear that God controls the movements of people. Acts 17 makes it clear that God is the one who controls the boundaries and times of humanity's dwelling. In other words, it is God who ultimately decides when and where people live. His all-powerful hand moves people all over the world. In fact Luke even tells us why God does this in Acts 17. It is so those people can seek God and perhaps find him. If that is true, then God is currently causing the biggest migration of peoples all over the world in recorded history, and he is moving more of them to our communities than anywhere else in the world for a purpose: that they might seek him and perhaps find him.

## What is diaspora missions?
At the November 2009 Lausanne Diaspora Educators Consultation held in Seoul, participants defined Diaspora Missiology as “a missiological framework for understanding and participating in God’s redemptive mission among people living outside their place of origin" ([Scattered to Gather](https://amzn.to/3b5DDVJ), 2010.).
